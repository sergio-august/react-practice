Learn how to use TypeScript with React. Start with a review of basic and complex types and functional and stateful components. Then use TypeScript interfaces to React code. Finally, learn how to implement higher-order components to reuse components while adding new functionality.

## Learning Objectives:
- Basic and complex types
- Functional/stateless components
- Class/stateful components
- Interfaces with React and TypeScript
- Implementing higher-order components
